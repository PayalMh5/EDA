# Perform exploratory data analysis on retail data with Python
Project scenario

An online retail company is looking to interpret its data to help make key business decisions. They want you to use exploratory data analysis on their transactional data, which contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. Your task is to explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products, in order to help drive business decisions

# Summary

Utilized data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to extract insights from Online Retail dataset, enhancing decision-making.

# Solution

The solution involved loading the Online Retail dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure and contents. Data cleaning addressed missing values, outliers (using z-score), ensuring data integrity. Visualizations identified trends, aiding insights into sales, customer behavior, and product performance. This comprehensive approach met project objectives by providing actionable insights.

# Approach

For the Online Retail project, I began by loading and examining the dataset to grasp its format and contents. Data cleaning handled missing values and outliers with z-score. Visualizations like monthly sales trends and customer behaviors used Matplotlib and Seaborn. Statistical analysis (mean, median, mode) clarified central tendencies, ensuring a thorough exploration to inform business strategies.
